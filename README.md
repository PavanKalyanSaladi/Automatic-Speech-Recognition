# Automatic-Speech-Recognition

This is an ML project which I have contributed to my PG-AI/ML in IIIT HYD.	<br/>
This model is to automate the audio to text convertion with live streaming as well.

As it is only available in my host machine, by using docker - it can run Anywhere, Anyone, Anytime.

The Dockerfile is the foundation that is used to create the docker image and upload it in the docker hub.

Clone the git repository--  <br/>
```git clone https://github.com/PavanKalyanSaladi/Automatic-Speech-Recognition.git```

Build the docker image by running the below command--  <br/>
```cd Automatic-Speech-Recognition <br/>
  docker build . -t asr:v5.0```
